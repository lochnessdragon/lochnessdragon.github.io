## Welcome to lochnessdragon's github pages site!

I do a lot of random things on github. I like to think I have some experience in a wide variety of fields. I know Java, C/C++, Go, Unity + C#, HTML/JS/CSS, PHP, Swift, Ink, Zig and Python.

### Current Projects
I'm currently working on a small video game and game distrobution platform.
